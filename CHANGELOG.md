## [0.7.8] - Unreleased

Portal MCP v0.7.8 is focused on query correctness, faster analytics, and release discipline. It keeps the interactive visual app work out of this release track so the tool/runtime updates can be reviewed independently.

### Highlights
- **EVM transaction type search** — `portal_evm_query_transactions` now exposes `transaction_type` and `scan_order`, enabling prompts such as “first Ethereum mainnet tx type 0x1 from block 12,244,000” without manual block-by-block clicking.
- **EVM investigator queries** — added method/event aliases, earliest/latest event and token-transfer scans, top-N transaction ranking by value/gas, richer client-side transaction filters, and `portal_evm_get_contract_deployment` for deployer/deployment-tx lookups.
- **Faster analytics windows** — added short-lived query caching and larger safe EVM time-series chunks so repeated analytics and comparison calls avoid redundant Portal scans.
- **Compact continuation UX** — improved next-step and pagination metadata so clients can continue older result pages without reverse-engineering cursors.
- **OHLC metadata improvements** — seeded known pool/token metadata for common Uniswap and Base pools so candle outputs can infer human-readable prices more often.
- **HTTP introspection** — added `/tools` and `/tools.json` catalog endpoints plus `/mcp` as an HTTP alias, with unknown routes returning fast JSON 404s.
- **Observability fixes** — canonicalized dataset metric labels, protected `/metrics` behind bearer auth by default, added dashboard long-window Loki panels, and added an HTTP metrics smoke test so Grafana data gaps are caught before release.
- **Real-time timestamp windows** — relative timeframes now anchor to the latest indexed block or slot timestamp and use Portal timestamp lookup on real-time datasets, including Solana 1h windows.
- **Release-note discipline** — release scripts now require a hand-written changelog entry before tagging instead of dumping raw commit subjects into `CHANGELOG.md`.

## [0.7.7] - 2026-04-10

### Breaking surface changes
- Redesigned the public MCP surface around user jobs instead of older mixed naming.
- Standardized public params on `network` and discovery filters on `vm`.
- Removed legacy public tool names and aliases from the exposed registry.
- Settled on `23` public tools plus `3` advanced/debug tools.

### Added
- Added Substrate support with `portal_substrate_query_events`, `portal_substrate_query_calls`, and `portal_substrate_get_analytics`.
- Added EVM OHLC via `portal_evm_get_ohlc`.
- Added EVM OHLC support for Uniswap v2-style swaps, Uniswap v3 swaps, Uniswap v4 PoolManager swaps, Aerodrome Slipstream swaps, and Uniswap v2 Sync-derived CPMM candles where factual.
- Added cursorable OHLC history windows for both EVM and Hyperliquid candle tools.
- Added `mode: "fast" | "deep"` to the heavier convenience, analytics, and OHLC tools.
- Added `from_timestamp` and `to_timestamp` support across the remaining convenience and analytics tools.
- Added percentile sections to analytics tools where they materially help interpretation.
- Added grouped trends and compare-period outputs with chart metadata and gap diagnostics.
- Added shared chart/table descriptors so clients can render ranked tables, time series, and candles without parsing the payload heuristically.
- Added richer LLM-facing response hints including `answer`, `display`, `next_steps`, `_execution`, `_tool_contract`, `_ui`, and `_llm`.
- Added deterministic `_freshness`, `_coverage`, `_ordering`, and `_pagination` metadata across the main public tools.
- Added compact and summary response modes for analytics tools.
- Added compact-by-default behavior for raw query tools so normal chat usage stays within context limits more reliably.
- Added live routing, conversation, negative, quality, and Substrate test suites.

### Changed
- Consolidated the public surface around discovery, recent activity, wallet summary, time series, VM-specific raw queries, VM-specific analytics, and OHLC.
- Merged older specialized time-series and comparison workflows into a smaller public entry surface.
- Reworked `portal_get_wallet_summary` into a true cross-chain convenience tool with shared top-level sections.
- Reworked `portal_get_recent_activity` into a normalized recent activity feed across supported VMs.
- Reworked `portal_get_time_series` into the main public trend/comparison tool.
- Improved dataset/network info with indexed head, finalized head, and lag reporting.
- Improved Hyperliquid analytics with short-lived caching and in-flight deduplication for repeated calls.
- Improved Solana analytics first-run latency by tightening default fast-path windows.
- Improved chart responses with explicit gap diagnostics and better descriptors for renderers.
- Improved public tool descriptions and examples for LLM selection and follow-up behavior.
- Trimmed default payload sizes for chart and analytics responses to stay closer to chat-sized budgets.
- Kept advanced tools available, but clearly separated them from the core public surface.

### Fixed
- Fixed partial-range scanning issues in aggregate and analytics paths where a partial Portal subrange could be treated as complete.
- Fixed Solana analytics continuation so live scans do not stop early on partial subranges.
- Fixed Hyperliquid OHLC window backfill and continuation behavior for longer durations.
- Fixed Hyperliquid OHLC bucket coverage for live windows, including the flaky `6h -> 15m` case.
- Fixed chain-mismatch UX so unsupported network/tool combinations return actionable guidance instead of vague failures.
- Fixed several raw query payloads to preserve useful inline context while still defaulting to compact mode.
- Fixed EVM OHLC defaults so recent trade tapes do not crowd the response unnecessarily.
- Fixed Hyperliquid analytics compact mode so it is meaningfully smaller than full mode.

### Testing and release process
- Expanded the live manifest to cover the current `26`-tool registry.
- Added dumb-user conversation tests to catch prompt phrasing and routing problems earlier.
- Added negative tests for unsupported-chain paths and bad tool choices.
- Added response-size and latency budget checks in `test:quality`.
- Made truncation a test failure instead of a warning.
- Wired CI to run the full `npm run test:ci` suite before the Docker build step.

### Docs and repo cleanup
- Rewrote the README around the actual public surface and usage patterns.
- Split public tools from advanced/debug tools in the docs.
- Removed internal-only tracked files from the public repository, including the local MCP config example, internal scope tracker, and internal agent metadata.

## [0.7.6] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- Added `portal_hyperliquid_get_ohlc` for trade-fill OHLC candles on `hyperliquid-fills`.
- Added chart-oriented OHLC output with `chart.kind: "candlestick"`, volume metadata, and automatic interval selection for common durations.

### Fixed
- Fixed Hyperliquid filtered stream walking so empty intermediate chunks do not stop later matching ranges from being scanned.
- Improved Hyperliquid OHLC backfill logic so chart windows are covered more reliably for longer durations.

### Changed
- Updated Hyperliquid docs and live tool-manifest coverage for the new OHLC tool.
- Bumped release version to `0.7.6`.
